<h1>What is BMI? Complete Guide for Indian Adults</h1>

<p>Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple measurement that helps determine whether a person has a healthy body weight for their height. It is widely used by doctors, fitness professionals, and health organizations worldwide.</p>

<h2>How is BMI Calculated?</h2>

<p>BMI is calculated using the formula:</p>

<p><strong>BMI = Weight (kg) / Height (m²)</strong></p>

<p>For example, if your weight is 70 kg and your height is 1.7 meters, your BMI would be:</p>

<p>70 / (1.7 × 1.7) = 24.22</p>

<h2>BMI Categories for Indian Adults</h2>

<ul>
<li>Below 18.5 – Underweight</li>
<li>18.5 – 22.9 – Normal</li>
<li>23 – 24.9 – Overweight</li>
<li>25 and above – Obese</li>
</ul>

<p>Indian BMI standards are slightly stricter compared to international standards because Indians are more prone to diabetes and heart-related conditions at lower BMI levels.</p>

<h2>Why BMI is Important</h2>

<p>Maintaining a healthy BMI can reduce the risk of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Heart disease</li>
<li>Type 2 diabetes</li>
<li>High blood pressure</li>
<li>Joint problems</li>
</ul>

<p>However, BMI does not measure body fat directly. It should be used as a screening tool, not a final diagnosis.</p>
